# NOTE: requires a GitHub token with with admin rights to create protected tags
#
# Created a github app to allow this action to bypass branch protection rules for tags

# Note: using a PAT instead of GITHUB_TOKEN to bypass branch protection rules and to trigger the release workflow
# since github actions can't start other github actions
# this needs to start the github_publish workflow
